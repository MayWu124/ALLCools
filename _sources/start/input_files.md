## ALLCools Starts From Mapped Data
ALLCools is designed for post-mapping data preprocessing ana analysis. 
Therefore, ALLCools start from mapped and demultiplexed data. 
Please refer to the data provider or corresponding methods/pipelines for 
demultiplexing single-cell reads and mapping them on to reference genome.

```{note}
For all the data generated by snmC-seq and related single-cell multi-omics technologies in Ecker Lab, 
we use [YAP](https://hq-1.gitbook.io/mc/) to demultiplex and map the reads. 
```

After demultiplexing and mapping, you should get one sorted BAM file per cell containing unique mapped reads, 
you can then [create ALLC files from BAM](#from-bam-to-allc) using `allcools` command line tools.

## Base-level, Single Methylome File
### ALLC File


### From BAM to ALLC


## Region-level, Multiple Methylome File


### MCDS File - N-D dense matrix for raw counts


### MCAD File - 2-D sparse matrix for hypo-methylation score
